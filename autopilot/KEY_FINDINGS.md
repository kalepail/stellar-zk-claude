# Key Findings

This file was reset on 2026-02-11 after retiring legacy AST0 run data.

## Enduring Engineering Findings

- Keep bots deterministic and verifier-first.
- Preserve strict legality fallback in runner paths.
- Prioritize reproducible multi-seed benchmarks over single-seed spikes.
- Keep roster curated and avoid retaining outperformed bot variants.
- Promote artifacts only when they pass current ruleset verification.

## Current Research Direction

- Re-benchmark active roster under AST3 from a clean baseline.
- Rebuild champion registry and keep-lists from AST3-only evidence.
- Continue profile tuning/evolution loops using current verifier-compatible outputs.
